Wk8 Assignment:

I achieved the requirements apart from building an active 'delete post' button. The current button is a placeholder for now.  
I also wanted to build the comments form on the comments page (as in facebook) but I couldn't get it to work in a client component.  
As both the delete button and the comment form should be working client component I could do with a refresher on this area.

My stretch goals would be:
To have a filter/search function.
To have a dropdown option to find your favourite villager and a link to an image of the villager and his/her stats (e.g type of villager/animal, birthday, favourite saying, how rare they are) - like top trumps. I looked into an API and there is one I could apply to use that contains all Animal Crossing data.  
Further a user login and rules section would go to ensure members are safe on the site.

Reflections:
Building something new with next.js, fonts and tailwind is a lot to learn. I gave myself a little time on each to read up on them before coding anything.  
I did the planning first then got the mechanics of the website to work first rather than doing one page at a time. Then spent time getting it to look smarter on the page.
I built separate files to get a couple of parts to work before adding them into the assignment code. I followed the workshops and demos to do this.
I'm finding next.js logical - I need to understand client components - and I'm warming to Tailwind. I googled a lot of tailwind code!
I could do with a refresher on fonts.
I prefer Vercel to Render.

Thank you
